# Automobile Industry Analysis

## Overview

The automobile industry, being one of the most significant globally, encompasses both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. This project explores key trends, predictions, and insights within the automotive sector, providing a comprehensive overview of the industry's dynamics.

## Global Vehicle Sales

It is predicted that global vehicle sales will experience a decline in 2021, with China recognized as the world's largest market for vehicle sales and production (Wagner, 2021). Analysts from IHS Markit, JATO Dynamics, Credit Suisse, and Nomura forecast a potential rise in the global vehicle market in 2021.

## COVID-19 Impact

The second wave of COVID-19 has implications for the automotive industry. Insights from Tarun Garg suggest that momentum in the automotive sector could be favorable during this period.

## Discrete and Continuous Probability Distribution

This project introduces concepts of discrete and continuous probability distributions. Discrete probability distribution involves countable variables with a finite number of values, while continuous probability distribution pertains to variables measured with unlimited values between specified points.
